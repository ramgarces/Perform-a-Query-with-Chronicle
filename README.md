<h1>Perform a Query with Chronicle</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough of the Perform a Query with Chronicle activity from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification course on Coursera. 
</br></br>
During this lab I will run basic queries on data to answer a series of related questions. For the queries, I will use tools such as the pipe and wildcard characters to refine the results as needed.

<h2>Programs and Utilities Used</h2>
